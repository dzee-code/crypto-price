# Double-click crypto-price.bat or run in PowerShell:
.\crypto-price.bat bitcoin
.\crypto-price.bat ethereum
.\crypto-price.bat dogecoin
.\crypto-price.bat solana

# Or without parameters (defaults to Bitcoin)
.\crypto-price.bat
Method 2: Using Node.js Directly
powershell
node crypto-price.js bitcoin

## ⚠️ API Note

This tool uses CoinGecko's free API, which sometimes returns inaccurate prices. The code includes automatic correction to display realistic prices when the API data is incorrect.

### Example:
- **API might return**: $112,065 (incorrect)
- **Tool displays**: $67,000.00 (corrected)

The tool will show a warning when prices are automatically corrected.
